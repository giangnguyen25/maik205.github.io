- Load versions from a file not from Mojang's servers all the time.
- Optimized performance

<h1 style = "font-family:Calibri;font-size:32px;">Maik's Launcher Alpha 0.1.0</h1>
    
<pre style = "font-family:Calibri;font-size:16px;">
Major Improvements:
- Support for cracked (Offline) and premium (Online) Minecraft.
- Implemented an automatic login system, will sign you out if you don't have internet access.
- Super clean User-Interface.
- On exit, the program will now clean all of the processes associated with the launcher.
- Working settings menu.
- Working server status (Mojang & a handful of your favorite servers).
- Good CPU usage (around 1-10%) most of the times.
- Uses not that much ram (90MB at max).
- Removed the old deprecated GUI, replaced with the new, cleaner one.
- Currently pretty busy so might work on this later.
- Quick launch (I guess).
- Compatible with forge.

+ Added a working VersionSelector
The version selector is still unusable with forge (unknown reason)
